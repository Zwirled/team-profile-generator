## Description

Week 12: Challenge 11 – Team Profile Generator

This is a command line application that prompts the user to input information about members of a development team. This includes managers, engineers and interns. The user is prompted from various information such as name, ID, email address and role-specific information. It generates a HTML file that displays all of the inputted information.

It uses the Inquirer packag to prompt the user for the team information, as well as Jest testing framework to ensure the application behaves as expected.
